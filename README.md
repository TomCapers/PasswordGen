This program is to generate a random password based on the user's criteria.
There is a minimum of 8 characters, but the user gets to choose between the combinations of upper/lower alpha, numbers, and special characters.
One concern at this time is if user selection is just special characters there may be an issue if their password length is over 10.
The functionality of passing the user's criteria to dictate which variable arrays are available is not working at this time.
There is still an undefined object that is preventing a password populating the app. To be resolved
